# 📘 Agile Project Demo: Runway Crack Detection App

## Project Overview
This project is a cross-platform mobile application designed to detect cracks in video footage.  
It uses a Flutter-based frontend and a Python FastAPI backend integrated with a YOLOv8 object detection model.  
The application allows users to upload videos, process them server-side, and receive annotated output with bounding boxes and detection summaries.
